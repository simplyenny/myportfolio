            <h2 class="head"> My Worries</h2>
            <p class="post"> I don‚Äôt know if this sounds weird or strange. But I am just worried.

                I even get worried a lot. Peoples ask why do you always worry, you shouldn‚Äôt worry, what makes you worried‚Ä¶and so on.
                
                So I decided to pinpoint my worries‚Ä¶.and I was able to streamline them.
                
                I worry about my level of success, I want more, I want to be really successful.
                
                I worry about my kids, am I doing enough, am I there for them, am I meeting their needs both physically, socially, psychologically and mentally.
                
                My job worries me, life worries me, I want more, I want to be there for my family, I want to be there for my kids. I want to serve God with the whole of me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
                
                I guess I‚Äôll just continue to worry till I can figure it all out.

                <p class="post">Hello mummies,ladies & babes‚Ä¶
                
                Top of the day to you!!!
                
                Being an introvert and a shy person, creating a blog seems weird and very new to me but yet very excitingüòÅüòëüòÄüòä‚ò∫.
                
                
                Over the years, I have discovered this burning passion in me to share knowledge, be a voice of change & help people through life issues, while sharing my story and personal experiences.
                
                
                Life is all about touching lives, adding meaning and value.
                
                
                The main goal of this blog is to bring people together from all works of life to share knowledge, advice and to discuss about every issue that affects us the female gender (as wives, mothers, women). Ranging from teenage years to adulthood; sex, food, marriage, health, pregnancy, children, education, spiritual, political and many more.
                
                Looking forward to learning from you all
                Its sure gonna be an exciting ride, hop along & lets embark upon this journey together. <br>
                
                Cheers,
